PCB, firmware, and FPGA development files for a small hobbyist computer board.  It's designed to be a generic platform for running classic games, but the hardware itself can be extended to other purposes.

My goal is to update my embedded hardware and software design experience, to provide a hobbyist reference design for HDMI and USB interfacing, and to create a "universal" classic gaming system to immortalize old games and play with friends.

Some features of the board:
  * ARM Cortex-M4 @ 160MHz (STM32F417VGT6)
  * Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA
  * HDMI
  * Ethernet
  * Full-speed USB host
  * microSD card slot
  * 32MB (16Mx16) SDRAM
  * Industry-standard JTAG headers for on-target programming and debugging
  * Powered by one 6-7V DC power supply
  * Fully open source, open-architecture C and HDL
